## RC micro service 
Rating and Charging micro service as part of RCB Cyclops consists of two sub micro services. To learn more about them please visit <code>rate</code> and <code>cdr</code> subfolders.

  - **Static Rating** - rates UDRs and creates CDRs based on specified rates
  - **Charge Data Records** - persists CDRs and makes them available to RCB Cyclops framework

In the near future RCB team will be releasing a generic Rule engine micro service, supporting domain specific business rules and flexible pricing strategies.
