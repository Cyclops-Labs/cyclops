			<h3>Cyclops Dashboard</h3>
			<span class="date">16 Apr 2015</span>
			<section class="box special">
				The first version of the RCB Dashboard is now available on Github! The dashboard is targeted towards a cloud service provider and their client. It has different views for an end user and a cloud administrator. The dashboard interacts with the different micro services in order to get the relevant data and for storing the configuration settings. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/cyclops-dashboard-usage-visualization-rate-configuration-billing-for-openstack/">Read More</a>

			<h3>SafeSwissCloud announced</h3>
			<span class="date">24 Dec 2014</span>
			<section class="box special">
				Flexible billing in Virtual Data Centers allows Safe Swiss Cloud to easily apply various charging models for its products and services and thus better meet clients needs. Also, it provides its resellers and partners instant access to the flexible billing system and start making business immediately without having to invest in their own billing systems. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/transfer-2/safeswisscloud/">Read More</a>

			<h3>A micro-service perspective</h3>
			<span class="date">12 Nov 2014</span>
			<section class="box special">
				Rating, Charging &amp; Billing has been an ongoing research initiative from ICCLab. As part of this, a proof of concept for OpenStack has been developed and released under Apache Licence v2.0. The PoC is a standalone application which can collect the resource usage data from Ceilometer for a certain time period interval, define a pricing function per user, determine the price for the resource used per user and eventually generate a bill and display it via a PDF. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/dynamic-rating-charging-billing-for-cloud-a-micro-service-perspective/">Read More</a>

			<h3>Cyclops demo</h3>
			<span class="date">27 Jun 2014</span>
			<section class="box special">
				In the past few months, the ICCLab has been developing a generic rating-charging-billing engine that would offer cloud service providers a modular framework that enables dynamic pricing activities and distributed design. The model follows the general accounting process, as well as provides a lot of flexibility due to the loosely-coupled design. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/rating-charging-and-billing-for-the-clouds-cyclops-demo/">Read More</a>

			<h3>Rating, Charging, and Billing for the Clouds</h3>
			<span class="date">11 Oct 2013</span>
			<section class="box special">
				Cloud has revolutionized the way we think of computing now - everything is on-demand, self-service, pay-as-you-go, and scalable. Although, these are welcome features that tremendously reduces the CAP-Ex and OP-Ex for any business, but the true potential of the clouds in regards to novel rating-charging and billing potentials has yet to be realized. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/rating-charging-and-billing-for-the-clouds/">Read More</a>

			<h3>Making money from your cloud services p.2</h3>
			<span class="date">14 Jun 2013</span>
			<section class="box special">
				It is very important to have the correct pricing strategy in place. In an arena which is getting increasingly crowded, it is very important to stand out from the rest. You can either create a cloud service offering which is truly outstanding in nature, but in this era of fast technology changes and cutthroat competition, very soon you will find your innovative space being encroached by copycats and other competitors. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/making-money-from-your-cloud-services-part-2/">Read More</a>

			<h3>Making money from your cloud services p.1</h3>
			<span class="date">12 Jun 2013</span>
			<section class="box special">
				Since most of us are pure technologists, we tend to overlook the importance of careful financial planning. Having a general understanding of the accounting process could help us create a sustainable business model for the cloud service offerings. So let us very briefly take a peek into a typical accounting process. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/making-money-from-your-cloud-services/">Read More</a>
