			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>The Scientific Foundation represents our strategic research agenda, which is driven by our core research expertise. It is defined along several strategic research themes, aligned with strategic collaborations, and implemented via a portfolio of research projects. At its foundation, RCB research initiative is supported by EU research projects such as TNova and Mobile Cloud Networking as part of European Union FP 7 Framework.</p>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>Providing impact, reaching uptake, receiving vital community feedback and validating ideas and innovation resulting from foundational activities. As an academic, and thus educational institution we naturally seek to share and thus publish our research via various publication channels with a focus on the academic domain, therefore the research outcomes from RCB initiative has been incorporated into ZHAW's Summer Schools program where students and faculties were introduced to Cloud Economics.

			<h3>Knowledge Transfer</h3>
			<p>Transfer knowledge and provide consultation to the Swiss high-tech SME market and thus contribute to the mission of ZHAW. The high-tech SME sector is the economic backbone of the Swiss economy and IT technology, with Cloud Computing at the forefront, is since long a strategic enabler and differentiation. In tune with its research approach, ICCLab has successfully started the knowledge transfer of RCB's research outcomes to the Swiss SMEs as part of Swiss government's CTI process.</p>
